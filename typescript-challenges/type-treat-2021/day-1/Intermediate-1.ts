// Costume prep time, you figure "why not dress up like
// the antagonists in the Squid Game?", it seems pretty easy
// based on your old Casa de Papel outfit.
// ( https://duckduckgo.com/?q=casa+de+papel&iax=images&ia=images)

// You set aside time to figure out what you're going to need to
// convert the constume and sketch out the potential work to
// give yourself an idea of timescale:

import {search, printer} from "type-or-treat"

const findOldCostume = () => {
    const jumpSuit = search.attic() || search.closet() || search.garage()
    const estimate = 30
    return { jumpSuit, estimate }
}

const createNewMask = (costume: ReturnType<typeof findOldCostume>) => {
    const mask = printer.printMask()
    mask.shape = "circle"
    costume.estimate += 60
    return { ...costume, mask }
}

const createBodyCamera = (costume: ReturnType<typeof findOldCostume>) => {
    const camera = printer.printCamera()
    // It will need painting too
    costume.estimate += 45
    return { ...costume, camera }
}

const assembleCostume = () => {
    return createBodyCamera(createNewMask(findOldCostume()))
}

// Great, this creates an assembly line of all the parts and
// the work you need to do. However, it relies on `any`s which
// makes working with the actual costume a bit ambiguous:

const costume = assembleCostume()
//    ^?

// Can you think of a way to fix the inference without creating
// new `type`s or `interface`s, or replacing the anys with `{ ... }`?

// Ideally this typeof problem can be solved so that you can
// make a change in one of the functions and not need to update the types.

// You'll know it worked when this line raises an error
console.log(`It should take about ${costume.time} minutes`)

// Now that we've got a working pipeline, can you generate a type
// which represents the end-state of assembleCostume so that others
// can re-use it later?
type NewMask = ReturnType<typeof findOldCostume>
